                            and Arrow
                            Functions

                        </h5>
                        <p class="card-text"><span class="fw-bold text-success">1. "this" value:</span> Inside of a
                            regular JavaScript function, "this" value is dynamic.
                            <br>
                            The arrow function doesn't define its own execution context.In other words, the arrow
                            function resolves "this" lexically.

                            <br>
                            <span class="fw-bold text-success">2. Constructors:</span> The regular function can easily
                            construct objects.
                            <br>
                            A consequence of "this" resolved lexically is that an arrow function cannot be used as a
                            constructor.
                            <br>
                            <span class="fw-bold text-success">3. arguments object:</span> Inside the body of a regular
                            function, arguments is a special array-like object containing the list of arguments with
                            which the function has been invoked.
                            <br>
                            On the other side, no arguments special keyword is defined inside an arrow function.
                            <br>
                            <span class="fw-bold text-success">4. Implicit return:</span> In regular
                            function, return expression statement returns the result from a function.
                            <br>
                            We can return values from the arrow function the same way as from a regular function, but
                            with one useful exception.
                            <br>
                            <span class="fw-bold text-success">5. Methods:</span> The regular functions are the usual
                            way to define methods on classes.
                            <br>
                            We can use the arrow function as methods inside classes.

                            and Block Scope</h5>
                        <p class="card-text"><span class="fw-bold text-success">The Global scope:</span>
                            <br>
                            A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions
                            or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by
                            any line of code in the program, including inside blocks.
                            <br>

                            <span class="fw-bold text-success">The Block scope:</span>
                            A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops,
                            are accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables
                            declared inside the curly braces are called as within block scope.
                            <br>
                            let & const are also called as block scope that is they are accessible within that
                            particular block. Here let is used for variable which can be changed as we proceed through
                            the program whereas const is used for a variable which doesn’t change till the program ends,
                            that is it remains constant throughout the program.

                            Loop work?</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            <span class="fw-bold text-success">The Event Loop:</span>
                            The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the
                            Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push
                            it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function
                            callback.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In other words, The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before
                            pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event
                            loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes
                            it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same
                            process.
